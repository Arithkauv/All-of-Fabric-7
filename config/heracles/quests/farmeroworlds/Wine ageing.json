      "Every 16 days (384,000 ticks), your wine will gain an additional year of aging, and every five years, it will gain an additional level to its effect up to a maximum effect level of 5. You don't need to perform a special action with your wine to let it age; just leave it in your inventory, a chest, barrel, cabinet, etc."

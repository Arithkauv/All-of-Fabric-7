This domain is massive, about 3.6 billion kilometers covering the surface. Let alone the depth of about 128 meters measuring from sea level, but considering that spans the entire domain, the amount of resources to collect would be unfathomable. Plus adding in the multiple ||planes of existence|| originally hidden from your own physical one, I wish you luck.",

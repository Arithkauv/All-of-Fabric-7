      "  Before you can even make /b/Bronze/b/, you'll need to put together a /b/--Forge Hammer--/b/. It's pretty much a bigger /b/Anvil/b/, but it's just got a flat top so you won't be able to use it as an anvil. Use it to make the basics such as /b/Plates/b/ and /b/Rods/b/. Though, /6/slamming/6/ the /b/Forge Hammer/b/ with an /b/Ingot/b/ can be very /6/inefficient/6/ and you'll get /6/less/6/ out of your /b/Ingot/b/ due to /6/damaged/6/ or /6/chipped/6/ metal. If you /6/craft yourself/6/ one of the various /b/Hammers/b/, you'll /6/increase the efficiency/6/ and your output; AKA the ratio increases. Once you use a /b/Hammer/b/, more formations of that /b/Ingot/b/ will open up to you. Be smart with your resources as the /b/Hammer/b/ won't last forever as its durability will eventually /6/diminish/6/ till it breaks.",

      "  You can also use the /b/Forge Hammer/b/ as a way of getting more /b/Raw Ore/b/ out of your /b/Ores/b/. Again, using the /b/Hammer/b/ will give you /6/more/6/ at the cost of durability.",

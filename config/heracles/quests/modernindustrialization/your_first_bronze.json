It's a simple mixture of 3:1 copper to tin in your crafting grid. Once you progress, you'll find a way to produce this mixture more efficiently since you're spilling some dust making it on hand.",

Remember that steam machines will accept inputs from any side, be it items, steam or another fluid. You can lock their slots by clicking on the padlock looking button in the interface. Locked slots will make sure the machine only accepts one type of item or fluid per slot.",

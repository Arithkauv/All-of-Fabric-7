      "You can shift-right-click on a machine to configure the output side. When you're holding the wrench, you can hover over any face of the machine and you'll see a grid of sorts on that face. Shift-rick-clicking on the middle square of this grid will set the output face to the side the grid is on. Doing the same to the rectangles will place the output on the face around the to that side, to allow for configuration in hard to reach spaces. Finally the small squares in each corner will set the output to the opposite face of the machine.",

      "Remember, you cannot break the machine using the wrench, it will destroy it and you wont get it back. Just use your trusty pickaxe instead."

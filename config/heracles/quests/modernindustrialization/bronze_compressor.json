      "This is the compressor and probably the first machine you'd want to build. Being able to turn ignots into plates at a 1:1 ratio is extremely helpful during the steam age. You save on resources and won't need to burn through hammers just to collect enough plates for your first project. It can also take those double ignots that you can stack with the forge hammer into --2-- plates, saving steam and time."

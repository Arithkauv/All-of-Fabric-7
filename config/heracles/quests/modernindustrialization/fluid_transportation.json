      "  You can forcefully initiate a connection by right-clicking the center of the pipe with your wrench, or by right-clicking a block with a pipe in your hand; thought it won't consume the pipe, just connect it.",

Luckily, pipes of different color will --never-- connect. Finally, right-clicking a pipe with a wrench will change the connection type and shift-right-clicking will drop the pipe.",

      "  Now, you might have noticed I said \"usually\" when talking about interacting with the controller. This means items and /6/fluids cannot be inputted or outputted from the controller/6/, but information can; in the sense of statistics. Looking into the controller you will see a few things: Shape Validity, Status, Progress, Recipe Base, and Recipe Current.",
      "<br/>",
      "  The Shape Validation will let you know if the /6/multiblock is built correctly or not/6/. It will not tell you if you are missing or have too many hatches on the multiblock, so you need to decide that for yourself.",
      "<br/>",
      "  Status will let you know the current status of the Multiblock. If it's idle or if it's active.",
      "<br/>",
      "  Progress will show you the progress, slowly building a percent to 100%. Depending on the speed of the process, the faster the percent will rise.",
      "<br/>",
      "  Recipe Base shows the /6/base recipe energy/steam consumption/6/. Depending on what you're making, it uses a minimum amount of energy/steam, but it can use more to speed up the process. This doesn't happen on steam machines so I won't got too far into it now.",

These can /6/mine/6/ in a /6/much larger/6/ grid than regular ol' /b/Pickaxes/b/ can; /6/3x3/6/ to be exact. Not only will you be able to /6/mine more efficiently/6/, but you'll be able to make beautiful /b/tunnels/b/ with ease.",

Just /6/Right Click/6/ the /b/fuel items/b/ into your /b/drill/b/ within your /b/inventory/b/ to/6/ fill it up/6/!",
